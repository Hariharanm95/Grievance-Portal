# Grievance Forum

The Grievance Forum is a specialized platform designed for the college community, facilitating anonymous communication between staff and the administration. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this application allows staff to anonymously post queries and grievances, which can be addressed and resolved by the admin.

## Features

- **Anonymous Posting**: Staff can share their concerns without revealing their identity.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Separate roles for users and admins ensure that each user gets access to the features relevant to their role.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible and functional on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
- **Secure Authentication**: Protects user data and ensures that only authorized users can access the system.
